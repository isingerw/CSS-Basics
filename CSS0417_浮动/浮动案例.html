				Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported after vaccination with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine
				(Oxford–AstraZeneca), a recombinant chimpanzee adenoviral vector encoding the spike glycoprotein of the
				severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1,2 To date, such reactions have not been
				associated with other vaccines against coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19). We describe a case of extensive
				thrombosis associated with severe thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation that
				resembled autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia3 in a patient who had received the Ad26.COV2.S
				vaccine (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen), a recombinant adenovirus serotype 26 vector encoding the SARS-CoV-2
				spike glycoprotein.

				A 48-year-old White woman with an unremarkable medical history presented to the emergency department
				with a 3-day history of malaise and abdominal pain. The initial evaluation at another hospital showed
				mild anemia and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 13,000 per cubic millimeter [reference range,
				150,000 to 400,000]). A peripheral-blood smear confirmed a marked reduction in the platelet count with
				occasional schistocytes. Additional studies showed a low fibrinogen level (89 mg per deciliter
				[reference range, 220 to 397]), a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (41 seconds [reference
				range, 25 to 37]), and a marked elevation in the d-dimer level (117.5 mg per liter [reference value,
				<0.5]), indicating a disseminated intravascular coagulation–like state. (A complete listing of the
					patient’s laboratory values is provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text
					of this letter at NEJM.org.) Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis showed
					extensive splanchnic-vein thrombosis. </p>
